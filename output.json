{"body":"{\"q\":\"How do I create an AWS Lambda function using the Lambda console?\",\"a\":\"You can author the code for your function using the inline editor in the AWS Lambda console. You can also package the code (and any dependent libraries) as a ZIP and upload it using the AWS Lambda console from your local environment or specify an Amazon S3 location where the ZIP file is located. Uploads must be no larger than 50MB (compressed). You can use the AWS Eclipse plugin to author and deploy Lambda functions in Java and Node.js. If you are using Node.js, you can author the code for your function using the inline editor in the AWS Lambda console. Go to the console to get started.\"}"}
